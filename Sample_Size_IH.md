# Number of samples required using the Maximum Probable Error (MPE) method

The maximum probable error (MPE) method can be used to determine the number of samples required to be analysed (analytical samples) to estimate the arithmetic mean of a population (µ).  This method has been referred to in the assessment of site contamination (ASC) literature since the mid-1980s (Provost 1984, USEPA 1985 and Gilbert 1987).

As noted by Provost (1984), “One measure of the quality of an estimate of an average is the confidence limits (or maximum probable error) for the estimate”*, with quality in this sense referring to the representativeness and precision of the estimate in relation to the population parameter. The MPE method assumes independent samples from a nearly-normal distribution, although for populations which are not normally distributed, this method provides an approximation which improves as n increases (Provost 1984).

Using this method, the number of samples required is controlled by:

1. the confidence level that is selected;

2. the variability of the sample data; and

3. the desired precision for the sample data.

Once a confidence level is chosen, as the variability of any population is generally a fixed feature of that population, only the number of analytical samples is able to be changed to provide more precise confidence intervals.  Noting that variability can be reduced in sample data by using stratified sampling designs, or by the grouping of sample data as like with like when conducting data analysis and interpretation, e.g. surface soil with surface soil, or fill material with fill material, etc.

In the reporting of sample results, it is desirable to quantify the uncertainty associated with any point estimates as the width of an uncertainty band or interval, with one such measure being the margin of error (MOE), which is used to define the confidence interval.  The formulae for which can be rearranged to give the number of independent analytical samples required to estimate the arithmetic mean for a specified MOE, and the MOE and s can be standardised as relative values by dividing by .  This gives the MPE (MOE/) and the relative standard deviation (RSD) (s/), both of which are reported as per centages.

As the variability of the sample data is required to determine n, either existing site data, data from similar studies, or from a small-scale scoping study, can be used as an estimate of the sample standard deviation.  Following any investigation, the sample data should be used to confirm the actual variability.

As MPE equation reduces to n = n, the MPE method cannot be used directly to determine retrospectively if sufficient analytical samples were analysed.  Rather, as part of the sampling design, it can be used to estimate the number of samples required, based on the estimated variability of the sample data, the selected confidence level and the desired precision of the data.  The resulting sample data can then be used to determine the MPE achieved for the sample data RSD for each analyte, and to decide if additional analyses are required to achieve a more precise MPE.

The desired MPE should be determined on a project specific basis, with a suggested range of between 25% and 50%; noting that the actual level chosen should be based on the project objectives, the site specific CSM, and the sensitivity of potential receptors.
